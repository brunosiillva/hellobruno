              I'm a Product Designer with over 13 years of experience in UX
              Design, combining strategic product vision with a rare technical
              edge: hands-on experience in frontend development (HTML, CSS, and
              React). This enables me to collaborate directly with engineers and
              accelerate the delivery of real solutions with more agility,
              consistency, and quality.
            </p>
            <p>
              At RD Station, I led the evolution and scalability of Tangram, the
              company's design system. With it, we were able to increase product
              NPS and reduce churn, directly impacting revenue growth. Beyond
              strengthening interface consistency and usability, Tangram drove
              significant team productivity gains, reducing rework and
              accelerating delivery. This enabled the company to launch
              solutions faster and with higher quality, maximizing product ROI.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a hybrid Product Designer, I can navigate both technical and
              strategic aspects, facilitating communication between design and
              engineering and ensuring that solutions are not only desirable and
              feasible but also executable and sustainable.
            </p>
            <p>
              I led the evolution of RD Station's design system, which resulted
              in higher adoption by teams, faster deliveries, and more
              consistent user experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe amazing products are born from collaboration between
              design, engineering, and business. I'm seeking new challenges
              where I can apply my systemic vision, execution skills, and
              passion for creating digital experiences that truly make an
              impact.

              <h3>Product Manager / Developer Experience</h3>
              <h4>RD Station - FlorianÃ³polis/Brazil (remote)</h4>
              <p>
                After several years as a Design System specialist bridging
                design and engineering, in 2024 I was invited by the Engineering
                Platform leadership to take on a new challenge as a Product
                Manager focused on Developer Experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                The goal was to enhance developer experience and productivity by
                creating a more fluid and efficient ecosystem of internal tools,
                with a special focus on the design system, delivery pipelines
                (CI/CD), repositories, infrastructure (e.g., GitHub and
                Kubernetes), and technical documentation.
              </p>
              <p>
                My background in Design Ops, technical knowledge in frontend,
                and close collaboration with engineering enabled me to navigate
                this new role effectively, combining product vision, user
                experience, and technical feasibility.
              </p>
              <h4>Key Deliverables:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Product management for the Developer Experience area, focusing
                  on internal tools, team efficiency, and technical governance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Continued work with the Design System, now from the
                  perspective of engineering and code scalability.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Direct interaction with developers to map pain points and
                  prioritize technical improvements.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Involvement with technologies such as GitHub, Kubernetes,
                  CI/CD, monorepos, Storybook, and others.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Participation in the definition of platform area strategy,
                  helping to connect design, engineering, and product needs.

              <h3>Product Designer Senior / Design Ops</h3>
              <h4>RD Station - FlorianÃ³polis/Brazil (remote)</h4>
              <p>
                In 2021, I was invited by design leadership to join the Design
                Ops team with the mission of scaling the design practice at RD
                Station, supporting the growth of both products and the team. As
                a Design System specialist, I worked directly on creating,
                evolving, and maintaining the company's design system, ensuring
                consistency, accessibility, and efficiency in the product team's
                deliveries.
              </p>
              <p>
                I collaborated closely with another design system specialist and
                the frontend engineering team, transforming design decisions
                into reusable, documented components aligned with the technical
                architecture. Within the Design Ops team, we also worked
                alongside UX Research and UX Writing teams, enabling a
                cross-functional approach across the entire product experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                During this period, I helped build the strategic vision for the
                area, defining OKRs and KPIs, and structuring a clear,
                measurable roadmap aligned with business objectives.
              </p>

              <h4>RD Station - FlorianÃ³polis/Brazil (remoto)</h4>
              <p>
                I worked as a Product Designer on a strategic internal tool for
                RD Station's finance team, used to manage subscriptions for the
                company's product plans. This tool also supported areas such as
                Customer Success and Support, which are essential for
                maintaining strong customer relationships.
              </p>
              <p>
                My main mission was to improve the user experience for various
                internal user profiles, ensuring smooth workflows for
                contracting, service, and financial management. I participated
                in the entire design processâ€”from research to
                prototypingâ€”proposing solutions that balanced technical
                feasibility, usability, and operational efficiency.
              </p>
              <p>
                During this period, I began contributing to the development of
                the company's design system, helping standardize components and
                best design practices across teams. This experience led me to
                expand my role into Design Ops initiatives and scalability
                efforts.

                  and support for multiple internal workflows.
                </li>
                <li>

              <h4>SATC - CriciÃºma/Brazil (in-person)</h4>
              <p>
                I worked on the marketing team at SATC, one of the largest
                educational institutions in Santa Catarina, providing education
                from early childhood through higher education. I was responsible
                for developing institutional campaigns and visual communication
                materials, serving diverse audiences including students,
                parents, staff, and the wider community.
              </p>
              <p>
                I created a wide range of printed and digital materials, from
                biannual campaign assets to everyday items used by the
                institution, such as school planners, internal signage,
                stickers, and materials for commemorative events. My work helped
                maintain a consistent visual identity aligned with the
                institution's educational mission.

                impact.

                I worked as a graphic designer creating visual solutions for
