            <p class="lead">
              I am a Product Designer with over 7 years of experience in UX
              Design, combining strategic product vision with a rare technical
              edge: practical knowledge in frontend development (HTML, CSS, and
              React). This allows me to collaborate directly with engineers and
              accelerate the delivery of real solutions with greater agility,
              consistency, and quality.
            </p>
            <p>
              At RD Station, I was responsible for scaling Tangram, the
              company’s product design system, contributing to faster delivery,
              standardized user experience, and reduced rework. I also served as
              Product Manager for the Developer Experience team, where I
              deepened my strategic role and expanded the impact of our
              deliveries.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a Product Designer with a hybrid profile, I have the ability to
              navigate between technical and strategic aspects, facilitating
              communication between design and engineering and ensuring that the
              solutions created are not only desirable and feasible but also
              executable and sustainable.
            </p>
            <p>
              I led the evolution of RD Station’s design system, resulting in
              greater adoption by teams, faster deliveries, and standardized
              user experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe that amazing products are born from collaboration
              between design, engineering, and business. I am seeking new
              challenges where I can apply my systemic vision, execution skills,
              and passion for creating digital experiences that truly make a
              difference.

              <h3>Product Manager / Developer Experience</h3>
              <h4>RD Station - Florianópolis/Brazil (remote)</h4>
              <p>
                After working for years as a Design System specialist and
                bridging design and engineering, in 2024 I was invited by the
                leadership of the Engineering Platform team to take on a new
                challenge as a Product Manager focused on Developer Experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                The goal was to improve the experience and productivity of
                developers by creating a more fluid and efficient ecosystem of
                internal tools, with special focus on the design system,
                delivery pipelines (CI/CD), repositories, infrastructure (such
                as GitHub and Kubernetes), and technical documentation.
              </p>
              <p>
                My background in Design Ops, technical knowledge in frontend,
                and close collaboration with engineering allowed me to navigate
                this new role smoothly, combining product vision, user
                experience, and technical feasibility.
              </p>
              <h4>Key Deliverables:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Product management for the Developer Experience area, focusing
                  on internal tools, team efficiency, and technical governance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Continued work with the Design System, now from the
                  perspective of engineering and code scalability.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Direct interaction with developers to map pain points and
                  prioritize technical improvements.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Envolvimento com tecnologias como GitHub, Kubernetes, CI/CD,
                  monorepo, Storybook, among others.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Participation in the definition of platform area strategy,
                  helping to connect design, engineering, and product needs.

                system, ensuring consistency, accessibility, and efficiency in
                the product team's deliveries.

                I collaborated closely with another design system specialist and
                the frontend engineering team, transforming design decisions
                into reusable, documented components aligned with the technical
                architecture. Within the Design Ops team, we also worked
                alongside areas such as UX Research and UX Writing, enabling a
                transversal approach across the entire product experience.

                During this period, I contributed to building the strategic
                vision for the area, defining OKRs and KPIs, and structuring a
                clear, measurable roadmap aligned with business objectives.

              <h4>RD Station - Florianópolis/Brazil (remoto)</h4>
              <p>
                I worked as a Product Designer on a strategic internal tool for
                the finance team at RD Station, used to manage subscriptions for
                the company's product plans. This tool also served areas such as
                Customer Success and Support, which are essential for customer
                relationships.
              </p>
              <p>
                My main mission was to improve the user experience for different
                profiles of internal users, ensuring smooth processes for
                contracting, service, and financial management. I participated
                in the entire design process—from research to
                prototyping—proposing solutions that balanced technical
                feasibility, usability, and operational efficiency.
              </p>
              <p>
                During this period, I began participating in the construction of
                the company's design system, contributing to the standardization
                of components and best design practices across different teams.
                This experience led me to expand my role into Design Ops
                initiatives and scalability.

              <p>
                I worked on the marketing team at SATC, one of the largest
                educational institutions in Santa Catarina, offering education
                from early childhood through higher education. I was responsible
                for the development of institutional campaigns and visual
                communication materials, serving diverse audiences: students,
                guardians, staff, and the wider community.
              </p>
              <p>
                I created everything from printed and digital materials for
                biannual campaigns to everyday items used by the institution,
                such as school planners, internal signage, stickers, and pieces
                for commemorative events. My work helped maintain a consistent
                visual identity aligned with the institution's educational
                mission.

                my expertise with large-scale communication projects that have
                social impact.
