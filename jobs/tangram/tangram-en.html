              <h3>About project</h3>
              <p>
                Tangram is the design system for RD Station's products, created
                with the goal of scaling visual consistency, team efficiency,
                and user experience quality. More than just a component library,
                Tangram has established itself as a strategic bridge between
                design and engineering, supporting different teams in building
                interfaces aligned with the brand identity and business
                objectives.
              </p>
              <p>
                The name Tangram was chosen to represent a set of modular pieces
                that, when combined intelligently, enable the creation of
                multiple solutions—just like the teams at RD build their
                products.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-challenge">
              <h3>Challenge</h3>
              <p>
                RD Station has a structure of multiple autonomous teams working
                on different products, with diverse needs and varying rhythms.
                This created challenges such as:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Inconsistent interfaces across products.</li>
                <li>Repetition of effort in design and frontend.</li>
                <li>Complexity in scaling new initiatives with quality.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Additionally, the design system had to be accessible and
                valuable for both designers and developers, providing tools,
                processes, and governance aligned with the company's culture and
                the evolving platform.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-solution">
              <h3>My role</h3>
              <p>
                I worked from the conception of Tangram through its
                consolidation as a strategic company initiative. My main
                contributions were:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Strategy and scope: I helped define the design system vision
                  by mapping the teams' real needs and connecting the
                  deliverables to business objectives.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Co-construction with engineering: I worked closely with
                  developers to ensure that the components were accessible,
                  reusable, and scalable, focusing on the developer experience
                  as well as the visual aspect.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Governance and support: I established processes to scale the
                  healthy use of the design system, supporting other designers
                  and teams with documentation, reviews, and alignment rituals.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Design Ops as a lever: I used Design Ops practices to
                  integrate Tangram into the daily work of designers, optimizing
                  how teams create, test, and evolve interfaces.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Education and community: I facilitated training sessions,
                  wrote strategic documentation, and helped foster a culture of
                  collaboration around the system.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="project-results">
              <h3>Impact</h3>
              <p>
                With Tangram, we managed to reduce rework, accelerate the
                time-to-market for new features, and increase visual consistency
                across products. The design system became an internal reference
                for UI decisions, being adopted by multiple product teams and
                directly contributing to the scalability of RD Station’s
                platform.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond the visual and technical gains, Tangram also elevated
                design maturity within the company, strengthening the
                partnership between design and engineering and increasing team
                autonomy.
